1. What is a Node module?

A file or directory in the node_modules directory that can be loaded by the require() function.
They contain functions and code that can be used to save time in app development (don't have to
implement things from scratch if they already exist as modules).

2. What is the main difference between exports and module.exports?
Module.exports is an object that is returned by the function require(). By default it is an empty
object. 'Exports' is not returned or an object, it is just a variable reference to module.exports that can
be used for convenience 

3. Why is using exports recommended?

Because it takes away the possibility of accidentally reassigning your export, which would
result in an unexpected functionality change. Since module.exports is the actual variable, it's
possible to change it via an expression (not ideal). Since exports is a reference to this variable,
it lets you USE it but not reassign it
